1) Replace "KYC Details" with "NIC Details." For all other fields, the client will consult with HR and provide further updates.
http://stagehrms-com.securecfml4.ezhostingserver.com/views/add_user.cfm
2) Create separate pages for Designation with options to List, Add, Update, and Delete.
3) Enhance all modules with a success message and a loader for better user experience.
When an action (Add, Update, Delete) is performed, a loader should appear, indicating that the process is in progress.
Upon successful completion, a success message should be displayed (e.g., "Department added successfully!" or "Changes saved successfully!").
Ensure the loader disappears once the operation is complete.
Apply this feature consistently across all modules.
4) Integrate a Departments module into the Employee Details section. When the "Add Module" button is clicked, a modal popup should appear, providing options to List, Add, Update, and Delete departments.
For reference, here are sample departments commonly found in an oil refinery:
Operations & Production
Process Engineering
Maintenance & Reliability
Health, Safety & Environment (HSE)
Quality Control & Laboratory
Supply Chain & Logistics
Utilities & Energy Management
Human Resources & Administration
Finance & Accounting
Research & Development (R&D)
5) We need a Career Level option on the Employee Details page instead of Role. The career levels like Career Level I, Career Level II etc. It should be categorized as follows:
a. Entry-Level Positions (Freshers & Junior Roles) (Career Level I)
Trainee Engineer (Operations, Maintenance, Process, HSE, etc.)
Junior Technician
Field Operator
Lab Analyst
Graduate Engineer Trainee (GET)
b. Mid-Level Positions (Experienced Professionals & Supervisors) (Career Level II)
Process Engineer
Maintenance Engineer
HSE Officer
Shift Supervisor

Supply Chain Coordinator
c. Senior-Level Positions (Management & Technical Experts) (Career Level III)
Senior Process Engineer

d. Executive-Level Positions (Leadership & Decision-Making Roles) (Career Level IV)

6) On the task list page, when assigning a large number of employees, I am encountering a design issue. The bottom scrollbar is not visible. Please refer to the attached screenshot for details.
7) We need to add Career Level-based Holidays to the system.
For example:
Senior Managers are entitled to 10–15 days of leave per quarter, in addition to casual leaves.
General Managers or Team Leads receive 12 days of leave per year, allocated as 1 day per month, which can be taken as planned leave, casual leave, or emergency leave.
